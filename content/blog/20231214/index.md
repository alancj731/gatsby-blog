I don't like letting Google save my passwords, even though I often forget them. So, I used Express to create a tool that helps me find my passwords stored in MongoDB. When I tried putting this tool on Azure, I kept getting errors saying I couldn't access files. After a few attempts, I switched to using Docker to deploy it on Azure. I had never used Docker before, but I learned from YouTube videos and Docker's instructions. The lesson here is, if you hit a roadblock, don't keep trying the same thing over and over. Try something different, try something new!
